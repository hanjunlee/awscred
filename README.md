## Concept 

The main concept of Awscred is to handle session token by creating a new AWS `credentials` file. **It helps you by abstracting the process which is to generate a new session token and to share it**. 

Suppose we need a session token and we want to store it. The first step is to generate a session token with `aws` command, when you run the command it returns json-format response like below ([aws doc](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/authenticate-mfa-cli/)). 

```bash
$ aws sts get-session-token --serial-number arn-of-the-mfa-device --token-code code-from-token 

{
    "Credentials": {
        "SecretAccessKey": "secret-access-key",
        "SessionToken": "temporary-session-token",
        "Expiration": "expiration-date-time",
        "AccessKeyId": "access-key-id"
    }
}
```

After generation, you have to set session token on your AWS `credentials` file if you need to sharing it, or you have to export values as environment variables.

```bash
# credentials file
[defuault-mfa]
aws_access_key_id = example-access-key-as-in-returned-output
aws_secret_access_key = example-secret-access-key-as-in-returned-output
aws_session_token = example-session-Token-as-in-returned-output
```

It is very complicated and also it is a toil because you have to do same process when session token is expired. 

Awscred makes you can handle session token without these complicated steps. What is you have to prepare is set the serial number of IAM user. It makes you donâ€™t have to put the serial number as parameter when you generate because itâ€™s stored at the `config` file of Awscred.

```bash
$ awscred set --on --serial SERIAL 
```

After configuration, letâ€™s generate session token. 

```bash
$ awscred gen --code CODE
$ export ...
```

Awscred will set session token on the `credentials` file of Awscred (not AWS) automatically.  

You can get some benefits by using Awscred. **The best thing is it doesnâ€™t intrude your AWS `credentials` by creating another**. In above example, you have to set session token with another profile(`default-mfa`) on AWS `credentials` to share it, but Awscred set session token with the same profile so you donâ€™t need to change your profile ðŸ™‚.  And Awscred copies access keys of other profiles on the Awscred `credentials` file so that thereâ€™s no side effect to replace `credentials` file.

## How it works?

- Daemon: it is running in background and keep reflect AWS credentials on Awscred credentials.
- Client: it configures settings and send a request.

## Install

### Source code

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:hanjunlee/awscred.git
$ mv awscred
$ go install
```

### Go 

```shell
$ go get -u github.com/hanjunlee/awscred
```

### Brew

TBD

## Usage

1. Run a new daemon - It creates a new daemon which reflect a session token on new credentials.

```shell
$ awscred run
```

2. Set up the profile - It configures the serial number and the duration. These values are used as options to generate a session token.

```shell
# set up the configuration
$ awscred set --on --serial arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXX:mfa/USER PROFILE

$ awscred info
NAME         ON       SERIAL                                    DURATION    EXPIRED
PROFILE      true     arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXX:mfa/USER PROFILE    43200       0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
...
```

3. Generate a new session token 

```shell
# generate a new session token
$ awscred gen --code XXXXXX PROFILE

$ awscred info
NAME         ON       SERIAL                                    DURATION    EXPIRED
PROFILE      true     arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXX:mfa/USER PROFILE    43200       2020-08-22T23:43:50Z (10.9h)
...
```

4. Modify the location of shared credentials file - By changing [the location of shared credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html#the-shared-credentials-file), `aws` command use the new credentials file. 

```shell
export AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE="~/.awscred/credentials"
```

5. Terminate 

```shell
# terminate the daemon
$ awscred terminate 

$ unset AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE
```
